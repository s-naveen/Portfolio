AboutAbout
At Zoho Corporation, my journey as a software engineer has been marked by a continuous evolution, from full-stack development to advanced encryption research. With a strong foundation in Information Technology from St. Joseph's College of Engineering, I've effectively leveraged my skills in JavaScript and Node.js to enhance our helpdesk product and create robust project management solutions.

Currently, as part of Zoho's Labs team, my focus on encryption technologies drives our efforts in developing secure, innovative algorithms. We've made strides in homomorphic encryption and are pioneering searchable encryption techniques, aiming to redefine data security standards. My role embodies a commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in encryption while maintaining optimal functionality for our users.At Zoho Corporation, my journey as a software engineer has been marked by a continuous evolution, from full-stack development to advanced encryption research.
